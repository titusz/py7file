{"name":"Py7file","body":"# Py7File - Simple file handling with python\r\n\r\n_Py7File wraps and unifies the python stdlib file handling modules with a simple_\r\n_and intuitive high-level api._\r\n\r\n* **Think**: os.path, shutil etc. via object based method access.\r\n* **Author**: Titusz <tp at py7 de>\r\n* **PyPi**: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py7file\r\n* **Source Code**: http://github.com/titusz/py7file\r\n* **License**: BSD\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUse easy_install or pip:\r\n\r\n    pip install py7file\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nHere some hopefully self explaining examples of Py7File usage:\r\n\r\n    from py7file import Py7File\r\n\r\n    the_file = Py7File('a_file.txt')\r\n\r\n    # Copy and Move\r\n    copied_file = the_file.copy('d_file.txt')  # copied_file is also a Py7file\r\n    the_file.move('moved_file.txt')  # moves the file and mutates the reference\r\n\r\n    # Backup and Restore\r\n    the_file.backup()  # creates a_file_backup_001.txt\r\n    the_file.backup()  # creates a_file_backup_002.txt\r\n    the_file.delete()  # removes a_file.txt from disk (ups...)\r\n    the_file.restore() # recovers file from a_file_backup_002.txt\r\n\r\n    # Unzip and Rezip\r\n    zfile = Py7File('a_file.zip')\r\n    zfile.unzip() # creates a folder a_file_unzipped with contents of zipfile\r\n    zfile.rezip() # repackages subfolder a_file_unzipped to a_file.zip\r\n    \r\nSee test_py7file.py for more examples.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nPy7File is tested against python 2.6 and 2.7\r\n\r\nTo run the tests:\r\n\r\n    python test_py7file.py\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nWell I am using this this file handling library quite extensivly myself and\r\ni got no complaints so far ;). Still please consider this Beta and\r\nuse at your own risk...\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nAs I started learning programming with python I found the different modules for\r\nhandling files very confusing and cumbersome to use. While writing my first\r\nscripts I found myself writing os.path.join(...) way to often. I still\r\nkeep mixing up os and shutil based file operations like copy, move, rename.\r\nSo I started this little module to make things easier...","tagline":"Py7File - Simple file handling with python","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
